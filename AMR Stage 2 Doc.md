**AMR Report Stage 2**

**Overview**

This report presents a detailed analysis of various antimicrobial drugs, focusing on their development over time and their antimicrobial activity. The drugs are categorized based on product type, subtype categorization, mode of action, route of administration, research and development stage, and clinical trial phase. Additionally, the effectiveness of these drugs against different bacteria is analyzed, with a focus on specific indications and antibacterial classes.

**Drug Classification**

The data are summarized under several key categories to extract essential information:

1. **Drug Types**:
   1. **Antibiotics**
   1. **Non-Traditional Drugs**: This category includes:
      1. Antibody-based drugs
      1. Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes
      1. Immunomodulating agents
      1. Microbiome-modulating agents
      1. Miscellaneous strategies
1. Figure 1 illustrates that 57.2% of the developed drugs fall into the Non-Traditional category. Among these, Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes are the most developed (>100 Antimicrobial), followed by Miscellaneous and Antibody-based drugs. Figure 2 shows that Bacteriophages are the most reported antibacterial class.

1. **Route of Administration**:
   1. A significant majority (69.2%) of antimicrobial agents under report are administered intravenously (IV).
   1. Other administration routes reported in the dataset include: 
      1. Inhalation
      1. Oral
      1. oral and IV
   1. Only one product each was administered via colonoscopy and enema  (Figure 3).

1. **Research and Developmental Phases**:
   1. Most drugs are in the Phase 1 trial stage.
   1. There is a notable decrease in the number of drugs progressing from Phase 1 to Phase 3, While only a few drugs have reached the pre-registration stage (Figure 4).

1. **Indications and Targets**:
   1. *E. coli-*targeted drugs are the most common in the dataset (Figure 5).
   1. Drugs targeting Gram-negative infections, “*S. aureus*, HAP, and VAP” infections are less prevalent in the data.
   1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile are the least targeted organisms but are of high priority due to their severe impact (Figure 8).
1. **Clinical Trials**:
   1. The clinical trial with the highest number of studies is NCT03788434 (Figure 6).

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the report highlights the dominance of Non-Traditional drugs, particularly Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes. It also emphasizes the intravenous route of administration and the predominance of drugs in early clinical trial stages. The data show a strong focus on E. coli, with less emphasis on other infections, and underscore the critical need for targeting severe pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile.
